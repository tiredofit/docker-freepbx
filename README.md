# Introduction

This will build a container for [FreePBX](https://www.freepbx.org) - A Voice over IP manager for Asterisk. 
Upon starting this image it will give you a turn-key PBX system for SIP calling. 

* Latest release FreePBX 15
* Latest release Asterisk 17
* Choice of running embedded database or modifies to support external MariaDB Database and only require one DB.
* Supports data persistence
* Fail2Ban installed to block brute force attacks
* Debian Buster base w/ Apache2
* NodeJS 10.x
* Automatically installs User Control Panel and displays at first page
* Option to Install [Flash Operator Panel 2](https://www.fop2.com/)
* Customizable FOP and Admin URLs

This container uses [tiredofit/debian:buster](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/debian) as a base.
        
**If you are presently running this image when it utilized FreePBX 14 and 
Asterisk 14 and can no longer use your image, please see [this post](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-freepbx/issues/51)**

# Prerequisites

This image assumes that you are using a reverse proxy such as 
[jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and optionally the [Let's Encrypt Proxy 
Companion @ https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) 
in order to serve your pages. However, it will run just fine on it's own if you map appropriate ports.

You will also need an external MySQL/MariaDB container, although it can use an internally provided service (not recommended).

# Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/freepbx) and is the recommended method of installation.


```bash
docker pull tiredofit/freepbx:(imagetag)
```
The following image tags are available:

* `15` - Asterisk 17, Freepbx 15 - Debian Buster (latest build)
* `14` - Asterisk 14, Freepbx 14 - Debian Stretch (latest build)
* `latest` - Asterisk 17, Freepbx 15 - Debian Buster (Same as `15`)

You can also visit the image tags section on Docker hub to pull a version that follows the CHANGELOG.


# Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). 
See the example's folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Make [networking ports](#networking) available for public access if necessary

*The first boot can take from 3 minutes - 30 minutes depending on your internet connection as there is a considerable amount of downloading to do!*

Login to the web server's admin URL (default /admin) and enter in your admin username, admin password, and email address and start configuring the system!

# Configuration

### Data-Volumes

The container supports data persistence and during Dockerfile build creates symbolic links for 
`/var/lib/asterisk`, `/var/spool/asterisk`, `/home/asterisk`, and `/etc/asterisk`. 
Upon startup configuration files are copied and generated to support portability.

The following directories are used for configure and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory    | Description                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|  `/certs`    | Drop your certificates here for TLS w/PJSIP / UCP / HTTPd/ FOP |
|  `/var/www/html` | FreePBX web files |
|  `/var/log/` | Apache, Asterisk and FreePBX Log Files |
|  `/data`      | Data persistence for Asterisk and FreePBX and FOP
|  `/assets/custom` | *OPTIONAL* - If you would like to overwrite some files in the container, 
put them here following the same folder structure for anything underneath the /var/www/html directory |

### Environment Variables


Along with the environment variables from the [Base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiredofit/debian), 
below is the complete list of available options that can be used to customize your installation.

| Parameter        | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|

# Maintenance

* There seems to be a problem with the CDR Module when updating where it refuses to update when using an external DB Server. 
If that happens, simply enter the container (as shown below) and execute `upgrade-cdr`, which will download the latest CDR module, 
apply a tweak, install, and reload the system for you.

# Known Bugs

* When installing Parking Lot or Feature Codes you sometimes get `SQLSTATE[22001]: String data, right truncated: 
1406 Data too long for column 'helptext' at row 1`. To resolve login to your SQL server and issue this statement: 
`alter table featurecodes modify column helptext varchar(500);`
* If you find yourself needing to update the framework or core modules and experience issues, enter the container and 
run `upgrade-core` which will truncate the column and auto upgrade the core and framework modules.

#### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. 

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is e.g. freepbx) bash
```
